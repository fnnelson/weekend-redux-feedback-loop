# Weekend Redux Feedback Loop

[Project Instructions](./INSTRUCTIONS.md).
BASE requirements completed, wanted to do stretch goals but didn't have time this weekend.  Will continue to work on this week to use Material UI, add home page, and 

## Description

I created a feedback survey that allows the user to choose between 1 and 5 for how they're feeling, understanding the material, feeling supported, and if they have any comments (comments are optional).  The summary page shows all of their choices to review before submitting.  After successful submit they are given the option to start the survey over with their info reset.
The information is added into a global variable object after every answer which is used at the summary page to POST to the server side and subsequently the database.
